<hr class="half-width"><p>Many qualitative researchers spend much of their analytic effort on
coding data, i.e. assigning labels to excerpts in the data. That is also
what we will focus on today. But before doing so, it is still worthwhile
to focus on <em>why</em> we code in the first place.</p>
<p>Coding is a form of abstraction: we make sense of large (sometimes
overwhelming) amounts of qualitative data – somtimes referred to as
“unstructured data” and generate some structure by coding it. This
abstraction is not cost free: by <em>forcing</em> codes onto your data,
you may lose some nuance and specificity. Some qualitative traditions
will therefore encourage you to only start coding once you are deeply
familiar with your data. Most traditions encourage an ongoing
back-and-forth between data and codes to make sure data and codes
match.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of codes varies strongly between qualitative
research traditions. In some traditions, codes are principally a
background tool, used to <em>organize</em> materials for later writing.
That is the case, for example, for most ethnographic writing, as well as
for many historically oriented approaches such as comparative historical
analysis (as used in sociology and political science) or process tracing
(as used in political science and administrative sciences). You will
rarely find a mention of codes, coding schemas, or a codebook in
published work using these methods, and not all of its practitioners may
apply codes to data at all.</p>
<p>In other approaches, such as thematic analysis or discourse analysis,
codes are a key <em>analytic</em> outcome. Here, codes don’t just
organize the data but are used a tool to give it meaning. In
publications using these methods, the codes and their development are
typically made explicit and often form the core of the methods section.
The tools we provide in this workshop can help you with either type of
analysis, but as you develop your coding schema, you want to be clear
where you situate yourself methodologically.</p>
<p>Beginning qualitative researchers often want to jump right into
analyzing data once documents are added to a project, but taking the
time to develop a coding protocol first can save time and improve the
transparency and quality of research.</p>
<p>The first step is typically to choose a coding philosophy, that is,
to decide <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> code labels will be chosen and
applied. Coding philosophies range along a spectrum from
<strong>inductive</strong> to <strong>deductive</strong> approaches.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="deductive-and-inductive-reasoning">Deductive and Inductive Reasoning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deductive-and-inductive-reasoning"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Deductive reasoning begins from assumptions and hypotheses. It seeks
to determine, using logic or data, whether the hypotheses can be shown
to be false (or true).</p>
<p>Experimental methods in many disciples follow this pattern. First, a
hypothesis or prediction about the effect of some cause is developed
based on past research and observation. An experiment is conducted to
isolate that specific potential cause, and conclusions are drawn based
on the presence (or lack) of difference made by the difference.</p>
<p>A medicine trial is a classic example of a deductive approach.
Scientists predict a treatment will help people in a specific way (for
example, by reducing the length of an infection). They recruit
participants (patients with the infection) who are randomly assigned so
that some receive the medicine and others receive a placebo with no
medicine. If the length of the infection is statistically shorter in the
patients who received the medicine, that is taken as evidence that the
medicine likely produced the desired result.</p>
<p>Deductive reasoning relies on minimizing exposure to outside
variables that might affect the outcome of interest, or otherwise
statistically adjusting for potential confounding factors.</p>
<p>Inductive reasoning, by contrast, seeks to draw more naturalistic
conclusions by making close observations while recognizing personal
biases and limits to observation. Inductive qualitative research draws
on patterns observed in data to make predictions, generalizations, or
analogies about more general patterns. Put differently, deductive
research is typically <strong>explanatory</strong> in nature, while
inductive research is <strong>exploratory</strong>.</p>
<p>Inductive social research often draws on critical or constructivist
perspectives that emphasize how individuals and groups describe their
own experience.</p>
<p>Taken in a longer scope, science can only develop through the
complementary use of induction and deduction, sometimes visualized as a
circular cycle. Observation is used to develop hypotheses, which are
tested deductively through more observation. If hypotheses are not fully
confirmed, inductive reasoning is used to develop revised or alternative
hypotheses.</p>
<p>[FIGURE OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESS]</p>
<p>Even though deductive and inductive reasoning are both part of nearly
every study in some way, how qualitative data is coded depends on the
general purpose of the study. Exploratory studies tend to adopt an
inductive method, while explanatory studies use more deductive
approaches to code development.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>In 1967, US sociologists Glaser and Strauss formalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory" class="external-link"><em>grounded
theory</em></a>, one method for conducting structured qualitative
research without presupposing a hypothesis or theory. They recognized
that how people <em>experience</em> the world can be at least as
important as traditional measures (i.e., personal income or gross
domestic product).</p>
<p>In grounded theory and other inductive coding methods, qualitative
data like interview transcripts are read carefully and initial codes are
applied that match the language and interpretation proposed by study
participants themselves as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Often, researchers label codes in this <strong>open coding</strong>
phase by using their judgment and experience to discern underlying
themes in the experiences expressed across interviews.</p>
<p>In our scenario, the goal of this analysis is to prepare for
collecting and analyzing new data related to social media privacy and
confidentiality. <code>BSR_05</code> is with a PhD student studying
political communication.</p>
<p>Open the <code>Coding</code> tab in QualCoder and click on
<code>BSR05_transcript_deidentified</code> in the <code>Documents</code>
list to open it for coding on the right. <code>Sara Mannheimer</code> is
the interviewer and <code>BSR05</code> replaces the name of the student
for privacy protection.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/qualcoder-coding-view.png" alt="Image of QualCoder with document BSR_05 open to the 03:49 timestamp in coding view" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Codes (labels) are applied to text segments that reflect a particular
concept, theme or idea. Before applying a code, it must be created in
the Codes list or the Code organizer.</p>
<p>We imported an existing project and the codes used by the original
study team already appear in the codes list. Before creating new codes,
take a look at the <em>coding tree</em> in the Code organizer
(<code>Coding - Code organizer</code>). After opening the organizer and
reading the warning about the risks of modifying codes, click the
outline symbol (<code>select code branch</code>), then choose
<code>All</code> and click <code>OK</code>. You should see each code,
with lines connecting codes to <em>categories</em>. Each category can
contain any number of codes, and categories can be nested within other
categories (i.e.,
<code>curation - technical requirements of bad</code>).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/qualcoder-code-organizer.png" alt="Image of QualCoder code organizer showing the 'curation - technical requirements of bad' category in a white box with 5 subcategories of varying colors connected to it via lines. The 'curation - innovative repository practices with bar' subcategory also has 2 subcategories of its own, one of which contains 3 codes." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We will use categories to distinguish between codes created using
different processes. Click the <code>Create category</code> button and
name a category <code>1_Mannheimer</code>; this will contain all the
codes created by the previous study team so we can easily separate them
from ours. To move an existing code or category under
<code>1_Mannheimer</code>, right-click its box and select
<code>Link code to category</code>. After selecting the correct code and
choosing <code>OK</code>, that code becomes a subcode of
<code>1_Mannheimer</code>.</p>

<p>The next exercise may be replaced with following the same directions
but for all existing codes in a longer workshop. The choice of a 2
minute time limit is arbitrary. If the longer version is used, only
<code>All</code> and <code>1_Mannheimer</code> should appear as branches
in step 3.</p>
<p>The choice of label (<code>1_Mannheimer</code>) is meant to ensure
the new code can easily be found at the top of the codes list later when
coding and is not necessary for the longer version (which can use
<code>Mannheimer</code> with a prepend).</p>

movement with some significant privacy risks, for example:</p>

<p>There are multiple words or phrases that might capture some of this
excerpt’s relevance for our research. Taguette allows applying multiple

<p>To apply multiple codes to the same (or overlapping) text, repeat the
coding process with another code. QualCoder will display the overlap as

<h3 id="in-vivo-coding">In vivo coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-vivo-coding"></a></h3>
<p>An alternative approach to inductive coding, <em>in vivo coding</em>,
tries to further reduce researcher bias effects by creating initial code
labels only from the language used in the interviews themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a passage slightly earlier in the paragraph we’ve been
working with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we ended up using that data for a project on looking at how
people disclosed early in the hashtag campaign, and how that may have
produced stigma around kind of disclosing for other women to disclose
experiencing sexual violence. So it was kind of a sensitive data
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person being interviewed used a number of words and phrases that
may be relevant to data privacy protection in these sentences including
disclosed, stigma, disclosing, disclose, experience, sexual violence,
and sensitive data. Rather than categorizing themes at this stage, in
vivo coding retains language used by the participants.</p>
<p>After creating another category for <code>in_vivo</code> codes, let’s
highlight “disclosed” and apply a new in vivo code called “disclose”.
The same tag can be applied to “disclosing” and “disclose;” although
they are different words, they have the same root word and express the
same idea.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/qualcoder-coding-invivo.png" alt="Image of QualCoder text coding screen. The code 'disclose' is highlighted in red within a category called 'in_vivo'. On the right, multiple words with the stem 'disclose' from BSR05 are highlighted in red." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>In vivo codes can be analyzed individually to understand specific
language people use or aggregated into themes during the axial coding

<p><strong>Autonomy</strong> might apply depending on whether the
harassment people experienced on Twitter included <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doxx#English" class="external-link">doxxing</a> or
otherwise involved personal information. Without access to the original
interviewee, it’s probably not reliable enough to use in drawing
conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise</strong> does not seem relevant here, as the
presence of online harassment suggests the advantage of
<em>stricter</em> protections, if anything.</p>
<p><strong>Stake</strong> clearly applies. The Twitter users are
described as experiencing <em>coordinated</em> harassment campaigns on
Twitter, meaning not only is the platform used to harass, but to
encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>Like inductive and deductive reasoning, the separation between
inductive and deductive coding is rarely complete. As a researcher, how
closely you adhere to a single reasoning or coding model will likely
depend on personal research questions and values, as well as norms in
the fields where the research will be shared.</p>

<p>The next challenge is designed to give learners time to practice
deductive coding and become comfortable coding longer texts in
QualCoder, but it requires a good deal of time. Below are some
recommendations for possible alternatives. Note that some examples in <a href="./04-qualitative-data-analysis.html">qualitative data analysis</a>
rely on this. A sample project is available in the lesson repository and
import instructions will be provided where relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative challenge options</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Split the workshop over two days and ask learners to complete the
challenge on their own time</li>
<li>Split learners into groups, each of which is responsible for coding
a single transcript (provide time and tools to share codes with other
learners)</li>
<li>Ask learners to code only one transcript or smaller sections of the
transcripts</li>
<li>Use the specific examples discussed in the challenge without asking
learners to code the full sections (can work as demonstration or
discussion)</li>
<li>Omit the challenge entirely and instead ask users to import project
with coded documents later (not recommended, as coding decisions are a
major challenge for qualitative research)</li>

<h3 class="callout-title">Practice deductive coding</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Practice coding documents by applying the deductive codes we
developed (<code>autonomy</code>, <code>compromise</code> and
<code>stake</code>) to some participant’s answers to the following
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell me about a time (if any) during the process of your example when
you considered issues of privacy (e.g. protecting data during research,
considering restricted access or TweetIDs only if publishing).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apply the three deductive codes to the following interview time
segments:</p>
<ul><li>BSR_01 <code>24:33 - 29:13</code>
</li>
<li>BSR_02 <code>35:09 - 44:21</code>
</li>
<li>BSR_05 <code>33:08 - 40:57</code>
</li>
</ul><p>This will likely take quite a while, particularly for those new to
qualitative coding. Don’t hesitate to get the attention of the
instructor or helper when you need assistance.</p>
<p>Read the surface text carefully, but also watch for implied reference
to themes. The excerpt below doesn’t include the word <code>stake</code>
or a synonym, but probably meets the definition that stake is when
“concern derives from being personally affected by privacy or
sharing.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BSR01 27:33 So they were anonymous in the sense that I couldn’t tie
it to their real identity. But some people use this same username on all
these online platforms. And that is that that is a concern. So let’s say
there’s a user in my data who said something they regret, and they
delete their post or their comment. It’s stil going to be there in my
data set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, all three deductive codes might apply to this particular
excerpt. Part of the concern is that users didn’t have
<code>autonomy</code> over how their data might be connected, and the
situation resulted from <code>compromise</code> between wanting to share
data openly while protecting user privacy.</p>
<p>At other times, the label for a code may directly apply, but it may
not be relevant to how the label is being used for your research. In the
block starting at <code>35:58</code> in <code>BSR_05</code>, we
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So at the time that we collected the data, you, you couldn’t get
replies to tweets through the Twitter API. So it’s like only the keyword
tweets. But we’ve felt that it was really important to have replies to
Me Too tweets, because that’s the conversational part. And so it kind of
put us into position where the only way to get them was to do the web
scraping, which is against Twitter Terms of Service, technically.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But we had conversations, that came up about whether we should use
them and whether… not like whether we should tell people we use them,
but like, yeah, whether we should use them in the analysis, which would
affect whether like we report it in the paper or not. So like, these
kind of back and forth conversations where a lot of… I guess like just
walking around the ethical markers, like trying to weigh, like, this is
the benefit of doing this, versus this is the cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So with the scraping, it’s like the benefit is—you get this much
fuller picture of me too. Versus there’s potentially legal consequences
here. And then with the releasing of tweet IDs, you know, the benefits
of open science, being able to facilitate further research on this.
Versus the cost, which is like potential harm to the participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excerpt discusses a process of negotiated compromise around
whether to use data gathered in violation of the Twitter terms of
service. The code we developed, however, is specifically for compromises
related to user privacy. In this case, there was no privacy issue for
users and coding this excerpt to <code>compromise</code> would serve to
confuse, rather than inform, our analysis.</p>
<p>Not all codes will necessarily apply in each document. In qualitative
research, both the content related to a topic and whether it is present
at all provide data to help understand people and contexts.</p>

to search all files (or one) and whether to use case-sensitive search

<hr class="half-width"><p>Most qualitative projects require more than one round of coding for a
few reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>The first documents rarely highlight every relevant theme. Themes
and language important in later interviews may still be reflected in
early interviews but less obvious before the theme was brought to the
researcher’s attention. Revisiting early interviews supports consistent
code application.</li>
<li>Multiple coders may use tags in slightly different ways, which
eventually need to be adjusted to a consistent scheme.</li>
<li>Key relationships between codes may only become obvious once initial
codes are considered, leading to consolidation or the development of new
tags as researchers become more familiar with the documents and
themes.</li>
<li>When coding in vivo, people may use language differently and
multiple phrases may represent a single idea.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Axial coding</strong> primarily addresses numbers 3 and 4, as
it is involves relating or further breaking down primary themes or
codes.</p>
<p>For example, the passage in <code>BSR_05</code> coded to
<code>in vivo - disclosure</code> concerned self-disclosure of personal
information during the #MeToo movement with the hope of reducing stigma
and producing a positive outcome. But Twitter users in
<code>BSR_02</code> may have been subject to disclosure of personal
information without consent. Axial coding might involve distinguishing
disclosure based on whether it was voluntary or self-directed.</p>
<p>Axial coding takes many other forms, depending on the research topic
and methods. Deductive research may revise and further specify existing
theory based on new data in their study. In vivo codes or open codes
that seemed distinct may turn out to be conceptually indistinguishable.
Participants may be provided summaries of initial findings and asked if
they reflect their personal experience. In all cases, axial coding is a
tool to clarify analysis and theory.</p>
<p>Qualitative studies typically have one or more rounds of initial
coding, followed by any amount of axial coding necessary to represent
key concepts intelligibly to both researchers and study
participants.</p>

<p>Coding view is optimized for reading through transcripts or documents
and applying a variety of codes, but it can be difficult to get a sense
of what all is matches a particular code in your document corpus using
coding view.</p>
<p>The <code>Coding report</code> allows you to view every text passage
coded to a single code (or set of codes), optionally restricted to
specific source documents. This can be a great help to axial coding
because you can look at one or more related codes more closely to see if
they should be merged, split, relabeled, or left as-is.</p>
<p>Create a report using <code>Reports - Coding report</code>. Nothing
should display in the right window, but sources will be listed in the
top-left and codes in the bottom-left.</p>
<p>Select only the Big Social Research interviews by right-clicking in
the sources, choosing <code>Select files like</code> and entering
<code>BSR</code> in the dialogue.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on privacy harms using the codes from the original study
team. Within the <code>Mannheimer</code> category (if you recoded them),
find and click the code
<code>privacy - considering potential harms</code>. When you select a
category or code, any codes linked below it in the coding tree will also
be included. Finally press the <code>play button</code> (right-facing
triangle) to run the report.</p>

<p>There is no authoritative right or wrong answer here. Whether to
combine or split codes depends on the research questions, methods, and
subjectivities, as well as on what participants tell you. The most
important guide is to ensure that you are treating your research
participants in a way that is faithful to their own experience, as you
understand it.</p>

<p>We won’t make any changes at this time, but if you did want to merge
2 codes, you would use the <code>Code organizer</code>, right-click one,
and select <code>Merge code into code</code>. Now both will be a single
code by the <code>into</code> name, which you can rename if needed.</p>
<p>QualCoder’s coding tools (specifically <code>Code text</code>,
<code>Code organizer</code> and <code>Coding report</code>) comprise the
core suite for the coding process itself. In the next section, we will
build on that foundation and explore qualitative and mixed methods
analysis methods that can be used in QualCoder.</p>
