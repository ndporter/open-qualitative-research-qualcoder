<p>For decades, a movement has been building among quantitative
researchers to share data and analysis as completely as possible. In
part, this is meant to improve scientific transparency, so findings can
be checked and verified, but it also serves to provide a basis for
future studies.</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers have been much slower to adopt data and
analysis sharing, for a few different reasons, including both technical
and normative constraints. On the technical side, qualitative data has
had limited standards, and analysis has often been conducted manually or
with specialized software with limited compatibility with other
software. More importantly, however, qualitative researchers tend to
emphasize the role of both the context of data collection and the
perspective of the researcher in the research process - in contrast to
quantitative methods that often seek precisely to minimize the
subjectivity of their methods and draw wide-ranging conclusions about
entire populations.</p>
<p>Moreover, qualitative data often presents challenges for protecting
privacy when sharing data, because interviews, focus groups, and other
qualitative methods provide rich detail that can make it easier to
identify participants even if direct identifiers are removed, as well as
often dealing with sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, however, there is a small but growing
movement to share and reuse qualitative and mixed methods data and
analysis, helped along by recent technical developments.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will start by exploring what advantages sharing
and reusing qualitative research can offer that might offset the
challenges it presents, then practice finding, reusing, and sharing data
and analysis projects with the largest qualitative data archive, QDR,
and the most widely used coding and qualitative data analysis software,
NVivo.</p>
<p>The data we will work with are real data, although the scenario we
use is somewhat artificial. Our goal is twofold - to help build literacy
and skills for working with secondary qualitative data using relevant
tools and to help develop an imagination for how you might reuse and
share qualitative and mixed methods data to improve your own
research.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The first step to reuse is to understand what elements might be
reused and why. Historically, research products like articles and books
have been the primary shared output of qualitative research. However,
there are at least four other common research products that may be
valuable for reuse or adaptation:</p>
<ul>
<li>methodologies and instruments</li>
<li>raw data</li>
<li>codebooks</li>
<li>analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, we’ll download some real qualitative data and
explore how each of these products might be useful to another
researcher.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Types of data</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Throughout this lesson, we’ll be using semi-structured interviews,
one of the most common types of qualitative data, in our examples and
discussion. Content analysis generally involves similar concerns and
processes, but uses other kinds of secondary data, such as published
print or audio-visual materials. Other qualitative methods, such as
participant observation and focus groups, may be somewhat less suited to
these tools and approaches and may require adaptation beyond what is
discussed here.</p>
<p>Part of the power of qualitative research is its recognition that no
method can be truly universal and that all analysis is contextual. We
encourage you to treat the discussion and tools here as starting points,
rather than templates.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Discussing data reuse in the abstract can only get you so far.
Instead, we will imagine we face the following scenario and working
together to discover how we can take advantage of others hard work to
improve our research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are preparing to conduct a study of social media users in
multiple countries, with a focus on understanding how people make
decisions about the privacy of their posts and profiles.</p>
<p>Participants will complete brief surveys about their demographic
background, participate in one or more semi-structured interviews, and
provide access to their posts on each platform they regularly use for a
period of 1 month. You are the lead researcher, but are joined by both
long-term collaborators and student research assistants, who are likely
to come and go throughout the expected duration of the research.</p>
<p>Your training in qualitative research makes you skeptical of the
value of data that was collected for other purposes, but you also know
you won’t have much time to collect the data and need to ensure you make
the most of the opportunity and structure your interviews so they can
reveal critical findings.</p>
<p>One of your collaborators referenced a <a href="https://doi.org/10.18452/25999" class="external-link">dissertation</a> that used
qualitative methods to study data sharing in qualitative and big social
research, and you noticed that the dissertation mentioned that
anonymized data are available online. Although your research questions
differ from theirs, you wonder if their interviews might help guide how
you approach your study and decide to take a look.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step to finding out whether this data can help is to get
the data.</p>
<p>Following the link in the dissertation, visit the data’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.5064/F6GWMU4O" class="external-link">summary page</a> at the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu" class="external-link">Qualitative Data Repository</a>, or QDR. QDR
<a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/about" class="external-link">describes itself</a> as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a dedicated archive for storing and sharing digital data (and
accompanying documentation) generated or collected through qualitative
and multi-method research in the social sciences and related
disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, QDR is a place for researchers to share qualitative and
mixed methods data in a variety of forms, as well as their analysis
projects. Some data are restricted and require an application or
agreement before using, but other data, including what we are interested
in, are openly available to any registered user.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/qdr-project-page.png" alt='Screenshot of a webpage titled "Interviews regarding data curation for qualitative data reuse and big social research" within QDR' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This project contains a wide variety of information, including:</p>
<ul>

<li>interview analysis</li>
<li>participant summaries</li>
<li>interview guides</li>
<li>study documents (consent forms, solicitations, IRB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the topic and the range of data available seem promising, and
the QDR Standard Access license agreement allows any registered user to
download the data, so let’s download it and see what we find!</p>

<p>QDR or your local internet network may be overwhelmed if larger
groups download the full project simultaneously. For this workshop, you
may choose to have learners instead exclude the NVPX (NVivo) file, which
will reduce the download size by around 95%. To do this: 1. Check the
box at the top-left of the file list (below the project description). 2.
Click <code>select all 42 files in this data project</code>. 3. Scroll
to the bottom of the list, navigate to the last page, and uncheck the
NVPX file 4. Click <code>Download</code></p>
<p>Alternatively, learners can select only the files that will be used
in the workshop. This is the most efficient but least like common data
reuse patterns, where researchers won’t necessarily know which raw

<blockquote>
<p>The data in this study was collected using semi-structured interviews
that centered around specific incidents of qualitative data archiving or
reuse, big social research, or data curation. The participants for the
interviews were therefore drawn from three categories: researchers who
have used big social data, qualitative researchers who have published or
reused qualitative data, and data curators who have worked with one or
both types of data. Six key issues were identified in a literature
review, and were then used to structure three interview guides for the
semi-structured interviews. The six issues are context, data quality and
trustworthiness, data comparability, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and intellectual property and data ownership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This short paragraph packs a great deal of information about the
interview topics and questions. Our topic of social media privacy may
share a good deal with some of the issues the original interviews
focused on.</p>
<p>For now, we’re going to focus on the Big Social Research group,
because the type of data they were interviewed about their work with is
the most similar to what our participants may be sharing. You may have
drawn a different conclusion, and likewise, each group might provide
unique insights.</p>
<p>If we can adapt questions and anticipate concerns and challenges
relevant to our data collection, we may be able to improve the quality
of our study and interview design, without repeating all the background
research from the previous study.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Interview schedules and study plans provide insight into <strong>the
research team’s</strong> expectations and approaches. The power of raw
data, such as interview transcripts, is that it shows (much more
directly) how <strong>the study participants</strong> construct their
own views of the study topics and respond to the questions. Context and
constructivism are core concerns of most qualitative researchers,
lending the raw data possibly the most critical aspect of data for
faithful and effective reuse.</p>
<p>It’s possible to conduct entirely secondary studies if enough raw
data are available in relevant context that address relevant topics.
Often, however, existing data serves as a type of pilot study -
providing initial evidence as to where to begin and what to ask while
still allowing the new research team to explore aspects of the data that
were less relevant or highlighted in the original study.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly-analyzed types of raw qualitative data is
interview transcripts, like we have in our project. QualCoder provides
support for working directly with audio and video files. Text, however,
is often preferred because it simplifies the process of removing
potentially identifying information and enables both rapid scanning of
content and accessibility technology.</p>
<p>Let’s open one of the Big Social transcripts,
<code>Mannheimer_BSR01_Transcript.pdf</code>, in your default
<code>PDF</code> reader (not QualCoder) and look at how transcripts are
structured in this project.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/big-social-transcript-image.png" alt="Upper portion of the first page of an interview transcript" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p><code>PDF</code> files appear as page images, but most modern PDFs
allow you to select text and other elements. In this transcript, we see
a few header elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The document title</li>
<li>A set of summary keywords identified by the original investigators
as relevant to this interview</li>
<li>A list of all speakers</li>
</ol>
<p>After the speaker list, the transcript itself begins with each
paragraph denoting a switch in speaker. The speaker’s identifier and a
time stamp for the start of the conversation comprise the first line,
followed by the transcribed text.</p>
<p>Reading even this first section in the image, we can get some insight
into decisions the research team made and how they worked. From
<code>BSR01</code>’s very first sentence, we see the researchers sent a
list of interview questions in advance but with mixed results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t looked at the questions you sent. Yeah, but this is an
active project. So I don’t think I should have a problem with any of
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The respondent may not have read all the questions but did identify a
project that the rest of the interview will revolve around.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Many qualitative researchers spend much of their analytic effort on
coding data, i.e. assigning labels to excerpts in the data. That is also
what we will focus on today. But before doing so, it is still worthwhile
to focus on <em>why</em> we code in the first place.</p>
<p>Coding is a form of abstraction: we make sense of large (sometimes
overwhelming) amounts of qualitative data – somtimes referred to as
“unstructured data” and generate some structure by coding it. This
abstraction is not cost free: by <em>forcing</em> codes onto your data,
you may lose some nuance and specificity. Some qualitative traditions
will therefore encourage you to only start coding once you are deeply
familiar with your data. Most traditions encourage an ongoing
back-and-forth between data and codes to make sure data and codes
match.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of codes varies strongly between qualitative
research traditions. In some traditions, codes are principally a
background tool, used to <em>organize</em> materials for later writing.
That is the case, for example, for most ethnographic writing, as well as
for many historically oriented approaches such as comparative historical
analysis (as used in sociology and political science) or process tracing
(as used in political science and administrative sciences). You will
rarely find a mention of codes, coding schemas, or a codebook in
published work using these methods, and not all of its practitioners may
apply codes to data at all.</p>
<p>In other approaches, such as thematic analysis or discourse analysis,
codes are a key <em>analytic</em> outcome. Here, codes don’t just
organize the data but are used a tool to give it meaning. In
publications using these methods, the codes and their development are
typically made explicit and often form the core of the methods section.
The tools we provide in this workshop can help you with either type of
analysis, but as you develop your coding schema, you want to be clear
where you situate yourself methodologically.</p>
<p>Beginning qualitative researchers often want to jump right into
analyzing data once documents are added to a project, but taking the
time to develop a coding protocol first can save time and improve the
transparency and quality of research.</p>
<p>The first step is typically to choose a coding philosophy, that is,
to decide <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> code labels will be chosen and
applied. Coding philosophies range along a spectrum from
<strong>inductive</strong> to <strong>deductive</strong> approaches.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="deductive-and-inductive-reasoning">Deductive and Inductive Reasoning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deductive-and-inductive-reasoning"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Deductive reasoning begins from assumptions and hypotheses. It seeks
to determine, using logic or data, whether the hypotheses can be shown
to be false (or true).</p>
<p>Experimental methods in many disciples follow this pattern. First, a
hypothesis or prediction about the effect of some cause is developed
based on past research and observation. An experiment is conducted to
isolate that specific potential cause, and conclusions are drawn based
on the presence (or lack) of difference made by the difference.</p>
<p>A medicine trial is a classic example of a deductive approach.
Scientists predict a treatment will help people in a specific way (for
example, by reducing the length of an infection). They recruit
participants (patients with the infection) who are randomly assigned so
that some receive the medicine and others receive a placebo with no
medicine. If the length of the infection is statistically shorter in the
patients who received the medicine, that is taken as evidence that the
medicine likely produced the desired result.</p>
<p>Deductive reasoning relies on minimizing exposure to outside
variables that might affect the outcome of interest, or otherwise
statistically adjusting for potential confounding factors.</p>
<p>Inductive reasoning, by contrast, seeks to draw more naturalistic
conclusions by making close observations while recognizing personal
biases and limits to observation. Inductive qualitative research draws
on patterns observed in data to make predictions, generalizations, or
analogies about more general patterns. Put differently, deductive
research is typically <strong>explanatory</strong> in nature, while
inductive research is <strong>exploratory</strong>.</p>
<p>Inductive social research often draws on critical or constructivist
perspectives that emphasize how individuals and groups describe their
own experience.</p>
<p>Taken in a longer scope, science can only develop through the
complementary use of induction and deduction, sometimes visualized as a
circular cycle. Observation is used to develop hypotheses, which are
tested deductively through more observation. If hypotheses are not fully
confirmed, inductive reasoning is used to develop revised or alternative
hypotheses.</p>
<p>Even though deductive and inductive reasoning are both part of nearly
every study in some way, how qualitative data is coded depends on the
general purpose of the study. Exploratory studies tend to adopt an
inductive method, while explanatory studies use more deductive
approaches to code development.</p>

<p>In 1967, US sociologists Glaser and Strauss formalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory" class="external-link"><em>grounded
theory</em></a>, one method for conducting structured qualitative
research without presupposing a hypothesis or theory. They recognized
that how people <em>experience</em> the world can be at least as
important as traditional measures (i.e., personal income or gross
domestic product).</p>
<p>In grounded theory and other inductive coding methods, qualitative
data like interview transcripts are read carefully and initial codes are
applied that match the language and interpretation proposed by study
participants themselves as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Often, researchers label codes in this <strong>open coding</strong>
phase by using their judgment and experience to discern underlying
themes in the experiences expressed across interviews.</p>
<p>In our scenario, the goal of this analysis is to prepare for
collecting and analyzing new data related to social media privacy and
confidentiality. <code>BSR_05</code> is an interview with a PhD student
studying political communication.</p>
<p>Open the <code>Coding</code> tab to <code>Code text</code> in
QualCoder and click on <code>BSR05_transcript_deidentified</code> in the
<code>Documents</code> list to open it for coding on the right.
<code>Sara Mannheimer</code> is the interviewer and <code>BSR05</code>
replaces the name of the student for privacy protection.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/qualcoder-coding-view.png" alt="Image of QualCoder with document BSR_05 open to the 03:49 timestamp in coding view" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Codes (labels) are applied to text segments that reflect a particular
concept, theme or idea. Before applying a code, it must be created in
the Codes list or the Code organizer.</p>
<p><em>Codes</em> can be nested within one or more levels of
<em>categories</em>, which can distinguish coding processes, larger
themes, or code status (such as draft). Importantly, and different from
many other QDAS, QualCoder does not allow you to code directly to a
<em>category</em> or to create subcodes of a <em>code</em>. They serve
different purposes.</p>

posts from the #MeToo movement with some significant privacy risks, for
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And a big part of our paper was we came up with a way of identifying
which tweets were disclosures which were not, and we have to describe
the method in the paper. And more or less, that’s a method to identify

<p>To apply multiple codes to the same (or overlapping) text, repeat the

<p>Unmark can also be used to adjust the start and end point of an

<h3 id="in-vivo-coding">In vivo coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-vivo-coding"></a>
</h3>
<p>An alternative approach to inductive coding, <em>in vivo coding</em>,
tries to further reduce researcher bias effects by creating initial code
labels only from the language used in the interviews themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a passage slightly earlier in the paragraph we’ve been
working with in <code>BSR_05</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we ended up using that data for a project on looking at how
people disclosed early in the hashtag campaign, and how that may have
produced stigma around kind of disclosing for other women to disclose
experiencing sexual violence. So it was kind of a sensitive data
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person being interviewed used a number of words and phrases that
may be relevant to data privacy protection in these sentences including
disclosed, stigma, disclosing, disclose, experience, sexual violence,
and sensitive data. Rather than categorizing themes at this stage, in
vivo coding retains language used by the participants.</p>
<p>After creating another category for <code>in vivo</code> codes,
highlight “disclosed”, right-click, and choose
<code>in vivo code</code>. This will add the exact word or phrase
highlighted as a code (if it does not exist). Do the same for other
language related to disclosure or sexual violence in the short
passage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="managing-in-vivo-codes">Managing in vivo codes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managing-in-vivo-codes"></a>
</h3>
<p>Before using <code>in vivo code</code> in QualCoder, it is best to
ensure all existing codes, such as themes, are added to categories. This
prevents mixing up in vivo codes with other codes.</p>
<p>When you have finished in vivo coding, codes can be moved to the
<code>in vivo</code> category by dragging them onto the category name or
right-clicking and selecting <code>move code to</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, you may also want to consolidate in vivo codes of the
same root word, such as <code>disclose</code> and
<code>disclosure</code>. Instructions for merging can be found under
<code>How much to code</code> above.</p>
<p>Be careful, however. If you move codes before coding is complete and
later code the same word or phrase, it will be created as a separate
code.</p>
<p>In vivo codes can be analyzed individually to understand specific
language people use or aggregated into themes during the axial coding
process.</p>

<p>Like inductive and deductive reasoning, the separation between
inductive and deductive coding is rarely complete. As a researcher, how

<p>Most qualitative projects require more than one round of coding for a
few reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first documents rarely highlight every relevant theme. Themes
and language important in later interviews may still be reflected in
early interviews but less obvious before the theme was brought to the
researcher’s attention. Revisiting early interviews supports consistent
code application.</li>
<li>Multiple coders may use tags in slightly different ways, which
eventually need to be adjusted to a consistent scheme.</li>
<li>Key relationships between codes may only become obvious once initial
codes are considered, leading to consolidation or the development of new
tags as researchers become more familiar with the documents and
themes.</li>
<li>When coding in vivo, people may use language differently and
multiple phrases may represent a single idea.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Axial coding</strong> primarily addresses numbers 3 and 4, as
it is involves relating or further breaking down primary themes or
codes.</p>
<p>For example, the passage in <code>BSR_05</code> coded to
<code>in vivo - disclosure</code> concerned self-disclosure of personal
information during the #MeToo movement with the hope of reducing stigma
and producing a positive outcome. But Twitter users in
<code>BSR_02</code> may have been subject to disclosure of personal
information without consent. Axial coding might involve distinguishing
disclosure based on whether it was voluntary or self-directed.</p>
<p>Axial coding takes many other forms, depending on the research topic
and methods. Deductive research may revise and further specify existing
theory based on new data in their study. In vivo codes or open codes
that seemed distinct may turn out to be conceptually indistinguishable.
Participants may be provided summaries of initial findings and asked if
they reflect their personal experience. In all cases, axial coding is a
tool to clarify analysis and theory.</p>
<p>Qualitative studies typically have one or more rounds of initial
coding, followed by any amount of axial coding necessary to represent
key concepts intelligibly to both researchers and study
participants.</p>

<p>Coding view (<code>Coding - Code text</code>) is optimized for
reading through transcripts or documents and applying a variety of
codes, but it can be difficult to get a sense of what all is matches a
particular code in your document corpus using coding view.</p>
<p>The <code>Coding report</code> allows you to view every text passage
coded to a single code (or set of codes), optionally restricted to
specific source documents. This can be a great help to axial coding
because you can look at one or more related codes more closely to see if
they should be merged, split, relabeled, or left as-is.</p>
<p>Create a report using <code>Reports - Coding report</code>. Nothing
should display in the right window, but sources will be listed in the
top-left and codes in the bottom-left.</p>
<p>Select only the Big Social Research interviews by right-clicking in
the sources, choosing <code>Select files like</code> and entering
<code>BSR</code> in the dialogue (it must be all-caps).</p>
<p>Let’s focus on privacy harms using the codes from the original study
team. Find and click the
<code>privacy - considering potential harms</code> category. When you
select a category, any codes linked below it in the coding tree will
also be included. Finally press the <code>play button</code>
(right-facing triangle) to run the report.</p>
<p>The report shows all three text chunks coded to any of the selected
privacy codes in the BSR interviews, with information on the code, file,
and coder in a highlighted row above the excerpt.</p>

<p>Other major QDAS, unlike QualCoder, allows coding directly to
categories. This project was originally created in NVivo and had text
coded to both codes and categories. When importing a QDPX project,
QualCoder creates codes with identical names when it encounters a
category with codes.</p>
<p><code>Privacy - considering potential harms</code> is an example of
this behavior, where a code duplicating the category was automatically
created.</p>

<p>By the end of coding, researchers can be quite familiar with the
data. Even if they have already drawn some tentative conclusions,
structured data analysis is important to validate findings, discover
alternatives, and document evidence and rationales. This step increases
the research’s impact and value not just for others, but for future
revision or expansion of your own research.</p>
<p>How you can analyze your data depends on multiple decisions,
including your software, the type of data you have, and how you
structured your codes. But the choice of methods also depend on your
research questions.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="cases">Cases<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cases"></a>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In qualitative analysis, cases most often represent individual
people, like those interviewed in the BSR interviews.</p>
<p>You may have already done some informal case-based analysis by
observing the types of privacy concerns different researchers
encountered or how they went about dealing with them.</p>
<p>Case analysis considers the similarities and differences between
individuals to help understand people holistically, including their
unique contexts. In its most basic form, reading an interview is a form
of case analysis. Often, researchers keep notes about individual cases,
which may include summaries of relevant information and thoughts about
how different themes and personal characteristics seem related in that
individual’s view of the world.</p>

<p>A case is not always a person. It can also be a document, an
organization, a news source, or another unit of aggregation whose
members are categorically distinct from one another. This primarily
occurs in content analysis, rather than interview and focus group
research.</p>
<p>Brittany Shaughnessy, for example, wrote a <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10919/103776" class="external-link">thesis</a>, studying gun

content analysis on Twitter posts from the official accounts of two
advocacy organizations: Everytown for Gun Safety (supports gun control)
and the National Rifle Association (supports gun rights).</p>
<p>In this situation, individual media relations personnel are not the
primary interest, even if we could identify them. The purpose of the
research is to compare the topics and language used by advocacy
organizations with contrasting goals.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="themes">Themes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#themes"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Themes inevitably emerge when studying cases, but in case-based
analysis are treated primarily as features of specific contexts.</p>
<p>Thematic analysis, by contrast, focuses on how themes are similar or
different across cases. Goals can include constructing general models of
a concept, discovering how circumstances can impact an individual’s
mental model of a concept, and testing the validity of theoretical
propositions in lived experience.</p>
<p>Each labeled code can be treated as a potential theme, and
<code>Coding report</code> provides a direct way to view all passages
coded to a specific tag. To see more context around the coded passage,
right-click the highlighted header above that passage in the coding
report, then choose <code>View in context</code>. This displays a pop-up
window centered on the passage that allows you to scroll through the
rest of the file.</p>
<p>You may want to take notes on sub-themes or variations within a theme
in a <code>journal</code>, a special type of memo in QualCoder meant to
record your thoughts when coding. Create or edit journals from the
<code>Manage - Journals</code> dialog.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can apply additional codes as you work more closely
with individual themes, although codes can only be applied after
returning to the <code>Code text</code> view.</p>

</div>
<div id="qualcoder-navigation-tabs" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">QualCoder navigation tabs</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>QualCoder features five primary navigation tabs, visible at the top
of the window: <code>Action Log</code>, <code>Manage</code>,
<code>Coding</code>, <code>Reports</code>, and <code>AI Chat</code>.
Switching to another tab and then switching back will not change what is
displayed in the original tab. This allows you to move freely between
managing files and journals, creating and applying codes, and viewing
reports without having to worry about re-creating your work.</p>
<p>Be aware that opening another dialog within the same tab or menu
(such as opening the <code>Code organizer</code> when
<code>Code text</code> was previously displayed) <em>can</em>, however,
replace the current display.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>QualCoder also provides a count of the number of passages to which
each code has been applied, which can give a quick sense of how
ubiquitous themes are across your data. Be cautious about using such
counts to draw conclusions, however. A theme may be mentioned only a
small number of times but still be critical to understanding a topic or
how subgroups of individuals think about that theme.</p>
<p>The <code>Code frequencies</code> report also allows counting the
number of times themes appear in a specific subset of files.</p>
<p>Code frequencies may provide an impression of how widely relevant
specific themes are. But again, counts cannot reveal the richness of the
stories qualitative research is designed to engage, so exercise judgment
before using them as a primary analytic tool.</p>

<p>Framework matrices are a type of visual organizer some qualitative
researchers use to conduct and interpret analysis. A framework matrix
places one case or group in each row and one theme in each column, with
the themes related to a single overarching framework. Once the table is
set up (on a computer or by hand), the researcher fills each cell with
one or more quotes or summaries that encapsulate that theme for the case
or group.</p>
<p>This process is undertaken systematically, following these steps

<p>In the matrix above, <code>Coding report</code> was used to find
sections of BSR interviews related to each of the three topics. For

the first column (based on the report shown below:</p>
<ul>

<figure><img src="../fig/qc_data_collection_privacy_coding_report_BSR.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Much of the work of analysis and theory-building is part of creating
a framework matrix, and so, by the time you finish, you’ll likely
already be much closer to answering research questions. That said, there
are also advantages to working with a framework matrix during the
analytic process, as well as their utility as a summary tool for
others.</p>
<p>Reading across columns (within a line) on a framework matrix allows
for analyzing cases. Reading down rows (within a column) allows for
thematic analysis. And having both summarized together opens up options
to study how clusters of cases may share similar approaches to themes.
This kind of intersectional analysis can be done informally, or can be
used to create formal case classifications or thematic typologies to
stimulate further theory-building and research.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Sentiment and degree</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Sometimes, particularly when considering deductive hypotheses, it is
not enough to code only for the presence or absence of a theme. In such
situations, semi-quantitative coding may be applied in one of at least
two ways.</p>
<p>Sentiment codes indicate whether the feeling or attitude expressed in
an excerpt of text is positive, neutral, negative, or mixed in relation
to a theme. Neutral and mixed can be hard to distinguish. Neutral
sentiment is generally unbothered about good or bad in relation to
something, while a mixed sentiment includes both positive and negative
feelings, often toward different aspects or implications.</p>
<p>In the excerpt below from <code>BSR_02</code>, certain Wikipedia
contributors are attributed a negative sentiment toward contribution
disclosures, which might also be framed as a positive sentiment toward
privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of them like hold ideological views that are against like the
counting of contributions. And they’re just like, “I don’t believe that
that’s something we should be doing. And so I want to remove myself from
this list.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentiment codes can be applied in the same way as other codes, by
creating a category like <code>sentiment</code> then adding codes like
<code>positive</code>. They work best when applied to the same excerpts
as a thematic code, so there is no ambiguity as to which theme is
associated with the sentiment.</p>
<p>An alternative way to integrate degrees of valuation into qualitative
coding is to code on a scale. For example, the amount of stake that a
sexual assault survivor has in protecting their identity from disclosure
is higher than that of a Wikipedia contributor who wishes to remain
anonymous to avoid attention. Scales typically are numeric with a
relatively small number of rating points, such as a three-point
<code>Low</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>High</code> scale.</p>
<p>Occasionally, qualitative data also asks about specific quantitative
measures that may have more natural units, such as a study of childhood
reading experiences that asks about how many minutes a day each parent
reads to their child.</p>
<p>QualCoder provides no option to directly attach a numeric rating to a
tag. It is again possible to create a separate set of codes to capture
ratings, as described above for sentiment, but not in the same way as
some other CAQDAS packages which provide integrated code scoring
functionality.</p>

<p>Many qualitative researchers prefer not to share or archive their
data and analysis. In large part, this is because of the amount of
interpretive labor they invest, along with frequent direct trusted
connections with groups and individuals being studied. This trust can
take time to develop before and during data collection, whether as
participants or observers.</p>
<p>There are important advantages to archiving and sharing data,
however, even for qualitative data. Each researcher ultimately must make
their own decisions, but this final section will outline potential
values and risks of archiving or sharing data, as well as how to go

users of other CAQDAS, however, you need to export the project with the
<code>Project - Export - REFI-QDA Project export</code> dialog. Choose
an option on the warning screen; if you’re not sure, choose the default
option. Choose or create a directory for the project and click
<code>Open</code>. This will create a file ending in
<code>QDPX</code>.</p>
<p><code>QDPX</code> files use the <a href="https://www.qdasoftware.org/project" class="external-link"><code>REFI-QDA Project</code>
standard</a>, an XML-based archive format that stores both source files
and core components of qualitative projects in a way that most major
CAQDAS packages can recognize and import. The components that can be
included are below (* indicates a feature is not fully supported in
imports/exports as of QualCoder 3.6).</p>
<ul>
<li>sources (text, PDF, image and multimedia formats)*</li>
<li>segments (specified chunks of materials/data identified as
meaningful by the user)</li>
<li>codes (labelled ‘tags’ attached to segments)</li>
<li>annotations (comments attached to segments, codes, sources or
links)</li>
<li>memos (writing spaces for analytical notes, either standalone or
attached to sources and/or codes)</li>
<li>links between codes, segments or memos</li>
<li>cases</li>
<li>sets/groups of entities*</li>
<li>visual representations of linked entities in the project*</li>
<li>user information</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also export only the codebook
(<code>REFI-QDA Codebook export</code>) if you only want to share the
names of codes and structure of the coding tree. This can be used by
researchers with similar data to create a parallel coding structure,
without the potential risks of sharing raw data. Codebook export files
end in <code>QDC</code> instead of <code>QDPX</code>.</p>

Manual</a>.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Each major CAQDAS package has its own proprietary data format,
specialized to its features. In most cases, projects cannot be moved
between software in these formats, although QualCoder does provide
direct import for <a href="http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/" class="external-link"><code>RQDA</code></a> data.
Data files in some software may also be restricted to specific platforms
(Windows or Mac) or software versions. In general, we recommend keeping
a copy of your final project in both the original format and in
<code>QDPX</code> format.</p>

<h2 id="data-sharing-for-collaboration">Data sharing for collaboration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-sharing-for-collaboration"></a>
</h2>
<p>Working with collaborators is one of the most common reasons for
sharing qualitative projects. QualCoder doesn’t offer a cloud storage
service that would enable real-time sharing, but projects can be stored
on a secure shared storage platform (such as Google Drive or Microsoft
OneDrive) and used by multiple users.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind to improve the collaborative
QualCoder experience:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plan ahead to ensure only one collaborator at a time is using the
data. Making changes to a project on multiple computers simultaneously
may lead to data loss, and you may not even realize anything is missing
or corrupted immediately.</li>
<li>When working collaboratively, make sure to change the active user in
<code>Project - Settings</code> every time you open the project. This
ensures coding and other changes can be tracked by user, and also allows
for later comparison of coding or <em>inter-rater reliability</em>
calculations with <code>Coding comparison</code> reports.</li>
<li>If multiple people are coding the same text, it may be easier to
agree on a single coding scheme and create the code tree before starting
the coding process.</li>
<li>If adding codes after initial tree creation in a collaborative
project, consider placing them under a <code>Draft codes</code> category
and using journals or code memos to document your reasoning until you
are able to discuss them with your team.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="exporting-project-elements">Exporting project elements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exporting-project-elements"></a>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes, however, you only want to share a specific portion of the
project with collaborators. Most views and reports in QualCoder can be
exported in a variety of formats, including <code>XLS</code> or
<code>CSV</code> (spreadsheet), <code>HTML</code> (webpage), and
<code>TXT</code> (plain text). Unlike sharing a whole project, exporting
individual project elements gives fine-grained control over the setup of
the exported file.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="transparency-and-reuse">Transparency and reuse<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transparency-and-reuse"></a>
</h2>
<p>Certain scientific disciplines have called for research transparency,
including sharing data and analytic procedures, with momentum growing in
many social sciences. Until recently, that effort was primarily applied
to quantitative data, such as surveys, experiments, and “big data”
gathered from the internet.</p>
<p>A small number of initiatives are working to change that perception
and promote the thoughtful, informed, careful sharing of qualitative and
mixed methods data as well, led in part by the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/" class="external-link">Qualitative Data Repository</a> and enabled
by improvements in sharing like <code>REFI-QDA</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="helping-future-you">Helping future you<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#helping-future-you"></a>
</h2>
<p>If the arguments above don’t convince you that it’s good and worth
the effort to archive qualitative data securely, there is one more
important case to be made.</p>
<p>Archiving your data in an open and interchangeable format that is
backed up in multiple locations can help future you. If your only copy
of your project is on your laptop and it is lost or destroyed before
analysis and review are complete, or if you decide you want to do
additional analysis later, there isn’t much that can be done short of
repeating a large amount of work.</p>
<p>QualCoder only stores data on your computer. Whether or not you plan
to share or reuse your data, consider exporting your project at key
points, such as after you’ve completed initial or axial coding.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#next-steps"></a>
</h2>
<p>This lesson has covered basic principles of qualitative research, as
well as how to use Taguette for qualitative coding and data analysis.
With that foundation, the next step is to find or collect your own data
and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>In addition to the Qualitative Data Repository (used and discussed
here), some other social science data archives such as ICPSR have
qualitative sections. For qualitative content analysis, there are
thousands of open-access archives of documents, research, education
resources, and even entire books.</p>
