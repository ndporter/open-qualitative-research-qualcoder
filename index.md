This lesson familiarizes learners with the application of open science principles to qualitative research and coding, with a focus on documents or transcribed text. Learners will practice working with secondary qualitative data from the [Qualitative Data Repository][qdr] (QDR) in the free software QualCoder and discuss the options and limitations for open research with proprietary qualitative analysis packages, including options for sharing both source data and coded analysis projects.

## Prerequisites

It is helpful, but not required, to understand some basic principles of open science prior to starting the workshop. A good place to start is this [overview][os_lightning_talk] from Jonny Coates, part of a [series of lightning talks][osper_playlist] for those interested in learning more about specific open science topics.

It is also helpful to be familiar with basic principles and practices in qualitative research, such as open and thematic coding.

No experience with qualitative software or QDR is necessary, but the lesson assumes participants have followed the setup instructions below before the workshop to install QualCoder and create a QDR account.
