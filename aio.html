<p>For decades, a movement has been building among quantitative
researchers to share data and analysis as completely as possible. In
part, this is meant to improve scientific transparency, so findings can
be checked and verified, but it also serves to provide a basis for
future studies.</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers have been much slower to adopt data and
analysis sharing, for a few different reasons, including both technical
and normative constraints. On the technical side, qualitative data has
had limited standards, and analysis has often been conducted manually or
with specialized software with limited compatibility with other
software. More importantly, however, qualitative researchers tend to
emphasize the role of both the context of data collection and the
perspective of the researcher in the research process - in contrast to
quantitative methods that often seek precisely to minimize the
subjectivity of their methods and draw wide-ranging conclusions about
entire populations.</p>
<p>Moreover, qualitative data often presents challenges for protecting
privacy when sharing data, because interviews, focus groups, and other
qualitative methods provide rich detail that can make it easier to
identify participants even if direct identifiers are removed, as well as
often dealing with sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, however, there is a small but growing
movement to share and reuse qualitative and mixed methods data and
analysis, helped along by recent technical developments.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will start by exploring what advantages sharing
and reusing qualitative research can offer that might offset the
challenges it presents, then practice finding, reusing, and sharing data
and analysis projects with the largest qualitative data archive, QDR,
and the most widely used coding and qualitative data analysis software,
NVivo.</p>
<p>The data we will work with are real data, although the scenario we
use is somewhat artificial. Our goal is twofold - to help build literacy
and skills for working with secondary qualitative data using relevant
tools and to help develop an imagination for how you might reuse and
share qualitative and mixed methods data to improve your own
research.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The first step to reuse is to understand what elements might be
reused and why. Historically, research products like articles and books
have been the primary shared output of qualitative research. However,
there are at least four other common research products that may be
valuable for reuse or adaptation:</p>
<ul>
<li>methodologies and instruments</li>
<li>raw data</li>
<li>codebooks</li>
<li>analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, we’ll download some real qualitative data and
explore how each of these products might be useful to another
researcher.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Types of data</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Throughout this lesson, we’ll be using semi-structured interviews,
one of the most common types of qualitative data, in our examples and
discussion. Content analysis generally involves similar concerns and
processes, but uses other kinds of secondary data, such as published
print or audio-visual materials. Other qualitative methods, such as
participant observation and focus groups, may be somewhat less suited to
these tools and approaches and may require adaptation beyond what is
discussed here.</p>
<p>Part of the power of qualitative research is its recognition that no
method can be truly universal and that all analysis is contextual. We
encourage you to treat the discussion and tools here as starting points,
rather than templates.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Discussing data reuse in the abstract can only get you so far.
Instead, we will imagine we face the following scenario and working
together to discover how we can take advantage of others hard work to
improve our research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are preparing to conduct a study of social media users in
multiple countries, with a focus on understanding how people make
decisions about the privacy of their posts and profiles.</p>
<p>Participants will complete brief surveys about their demographic
background, participate in one or more semi-structured interviews, and
provide access to their posts on each platform they regularly use for a
period of 1 month. You are the lead researcher, but are joined by both
long-term collaborators and student research assistants, who are likely
to come and go throughout the expected duration of the research.</p>
<p>Your training in qualitative research makes you skeptical of the
value of data that was collected for other purposes, but you also know
you won’t have much time to collect the data and need to ensure you make
the most of the opportunity and structure your interviews so they can
reveal critical findings.</p>
<p>One of your collaborators referenced a <a href="https://doi.org/10.18452/25999" class="external-link">dissertation</a> that used
qualitative methods to study data sharing in qualitative and big social
research, and you noticed that the dissertation mentioned that
anonymized data are available online. Although your research questions
differ from theirs, you wonder if their interviews might help guide how
you approach your study and decide to take a look.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step to finding out whether this data can help is to get
the data.</p>
<p>Following the link in the dissertation, visit the data’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.5064/F6GWMU4O" class="external-link">summary page</a> at the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu" class="external-link">Qualitative Data Repository</a>, or QDR. QDR
<a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/about" class="external-link">describes itself</a> as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a dedicated archive for storing and sharing digital data (and
accompanying documentation) generated or collected through qualitative
and multi-method research in the social sciences and related
disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, QDR is a place for researchers to share qualitative and
mixed methods data in a variety of forms, as well as their analysis
projects. Some data are restricted and require an application or
agreement before using, but other data, including what we are interested
in, are openly available to any registered user.</p>
<p>Before going to the trouble of registering, let’s take a look at what
is actually available in this data collection.</p>

<p>Maybe you noticed something interesting about the interview topics in

<p>In collections of data or other multi-file downloads, there is often
a file named <code>readme.txt</code> or something similar. These are
meant to provide an overview of the collection and how to go about using
them.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s zero in on the first paragraph under
<code>Data Description and Collection Overview</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data in this study was collected using semi-structured interviews
that centered around specific incidents of qualitative data archiving or
reuse, big social research, or data curation. The participants for the
interviews were therefore drawn from three categories: researchers who
have used big social data, qualitative researchers who have published or
reused qualitative data, and data curators who have worked with one or
both types of data. Six key issues were identified in a literature
review, and were then used to structure three interview guides for the
semi-structured interviews. The six issues are context, data quality and
trustworthiness, data comparability, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and intellectual property and data ownership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This short paragraph packs a great deal of information about the
interview topics and questions. Our topic of social media privacy may
share a good deal with some of the issues the original interviews
focused on. Let’s look a little deeper into what we can learn to help in
our own study.</p>
<div id="reviewing-study-materials" class="callout discussion">

</div>
<div id="reviewing-study-materials" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Reviewing study materials</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Study materials from previous studies, like interview schedules or
participant observation memos, provide a window into what might work for
other related studies, including both what to ask and how to approach
asking. Moreover, if the research dealt with a similar study population
and the final product addressed topics of interest in your study as
well, it also provides some evidence that a similar study design can be
effective not just in theory but in practice.</p>
<p>Use the information in <code>README_Mannheimer.txt</code> to locate
the 3 interview guides and use the readme and guides to answer the
following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which of the six issues the researchers identified seem most
relevant to planning your study? Why?</li>
<li>Is one of the original study populations more relevant to
understanding shared issues with your study? Which one and why?</li>
<li>Read through the questions in the interview guide for the most
relevant population you identified above. Are there questions that might
be adapted or borrowed for your own interviews about social media
privacy decisions?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For now, we’re going to focus on the Big Social Research group,
because the type of data they were interviewed about their work with is
the most similar to what our participants may be sharing. You may have
drawn a different conclusion, and likewise, each group might provide
unique insights.</p>
<p>If we can adapt questions and anticipate concerns and challenges
relevant to our data collection, we may be able to improve the quality
of our study and interview design, without repeating all the background
research from the previous study.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="raw-data">Raw Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#raw-data"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Interview schedules and study plans provide insight into <strong>the
research team’s</strong> expectations and approaches. The power of raw
data, such as interview transcripts, is that it shows (much more
directly) how <strong>the study participants</strong> construct their
own views of the study topics and respond to the questions. Context and
constructivism are core concerns of most qualitative researchers,
leading the raw data to be possibly the most critical aspect of data for
faithful and effective reuse.</p>
<p>It’s possible to conduct entirely secondary studies if enough raw
data are available in relevant context that address relevant topics.
Often, however, existing data serves as a type of pilot study -
providing initial evidence as to where to begin and what to ask while
still allowing the new research team to explore aspects of the data that
were less relevant or highlighted in the original study.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly-analyzed types of raw qualitative data is
interview transcripts, like we have in our project. QualCoder provides
support for working directly with audio and video files. Text, however,
is often preferred because it simplifies the process of removing
potentially identifying information and enables both rapid scanning of
content and accessibility technology.</p>
<p>Let’s open one of the Big Social transcripts,
<code>Mannheimer_BSR01_Transcript.pdf</code>, in your default
<code>PDF</code> reader and look at how transcripts are structured in
this project.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/big-social-transcript-image.png" alt="Upper portion of the first page of an interview transcript" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p><code>PDF</code> files appear as page images, but most modern PDFs
allow you to select text and other elements. In this transcript, we see
a few header elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The document title</li>
<li>A set of summary keywords identified by the original investigators
as relevant to this interview</li>
<li>A list of all speakers</li>
</ol>
<p>After the speaker list, the transcript itself begins with each
paragraph denoting a switch in speaker. The speaker’s identifier and a
time stamp for the start of the conversation comprise the first line,
followed by the transcribed text.</p>
<p>Reading even this first section in the image, we can get some insight
into decisions the research team made and how they worked. From
<code>BSR01</code>’s very first sentence, we see the researchers sent a
list of interview questions in advance but with mixed results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t looked at the questions you sent. Yeah, but this is an
active project. So I don’t think I should have a problem with any of
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The respondent may not have read all the questions but did identify a
project that the rest of the interview will revolve around.</p>

<p>Read the following excerpt from <code>BSR01</code>s interview and
consider the questions below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sara Mannheimer</strong></p>
<p>All right on to privacy and confidentiality. Can you tell me about a
time if any during your research process when you considered issues of
privacy, protecting the data during your research or protecting the
people on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>BSR01 25:03</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so a good example of that would be my previous project where I
was looking at biases in the language of peer review. I was looking at
gender bias, what are the biases looking with gender bias. For that we
had an external annotator annotate gender for the authors on the
platform of these papers. And the protocol we followed was semi
automatic. So we use the US Social Security data to infer genders with
some confidence probability. For example, if there was a certain name,
let’s say Jack, that was reported as male 99% of the time, we would tag
it as male. And same thing if it was reported as female and 99% time we
would tag it as female or non male rather. But if it was less confident,
we had the human annotator, search for the name search for their Google
profile and make a guess as to what this person’s gender is. So we were,
so we were trying to mimic the reviewers perception of the author’s
agenda. And because bias, the bias would be driven based on that
perception, and not the self reported gender of the author. We did not
release these gender annotations, because we didn’t, we thought it would
cause issues if we mislabeled an author’s gender. And these authors are
a part of the community that we publish. Yeah. So we opted to not
release identities. And we actually at the end of the paper, we actually
have an ethics statement where we talk about why we’re not doing that.
But the data, the data itself is public.</p>
<p><strong>Sara Mannheimer 27:08</strong></p>
<p>And I guess sometimes with social media, there are like
considerations of move it, like moving the data out, out of its context,
in Reddit, you know, and you’re letting it be downloaded. I think in
your situation, since all of the users were anonymous, that changes
things a little.</p>
<p><strong>BSR01 27:33</strong></p>
<p>So they were anonymous in the sense that I couldn’t tie it to their
real identity. But some people use this same username on all these
online platforms. And that is that that is a concern. So let’s say
there’s a user in my data who said something they regret, and they
delete their post or their comment. It’s still going to be there in my
data set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your study, again, is focused on the decisions individual social
media users make about the privacy of their posts. This excerpt is
primarily focused on how researchers protect (or fail to protect) the
privacy of online users.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What direct discussion, if any, is there of user privacy decision
processes here?</li>
<li>How might the example of name matching processes used by

your study participants?</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the past, qualitative data was rarely shared or reused beyond the
original study team, but two factors make it easier than ever before to
reuse qualitative data. First, repositories like QDR are helping
normalize the sharing of qualitative data to reuse for research,
transparency, and teaching. Second, a new data standard called
[REFI-QDA][<a href="https://www.qdasoftware.org/" class="external-link uri">https://www.qdasoftware.org/</a>] was introduced in 2019
that allows analysis projects created in one software package to be
reused, even by users with different software. REFI-QDA projects allow
sharing not just raw data, but codes, coded text, and even certain
analytic outputs.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>REFI-QDA projects are saved as compressed folders with either a
<code>QDPX</code> or <code>ZIP</code> extension, depending on export
software. They contain both the project’s raw data files and
<code>XML</code> files with a custom schema including sources, segments,
codes, annotations, memos, links, cases, sets, and sometimes visual
representations of linked entities, as well as user information (used to
distinguish multiple coders on one project, for example). Two sets of
standards were developed, one for sharing only the codebook for a
project, and one for sharing the entire project.</p>
<p>Not all software that supports REFI-QDA includes all parts of the
standard, but because the standard was designed in collaboration with
almost all major CAQDAS software developers, it is a major step toward
an open interoperability standard. And because XML is an uncompiled text
data format, QDPX projects can even be accessed in other software (such
as R or Python) by developers familiar with the standard.</p>
<p>QualCoder is (as of 2025) the only free CAQDAS which supports both
codebook and project import and export using REFI-QDA.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Many qualitative researchers spend much of their analytic effort on
coding data, i.e. assigning labels to excerpts in the data. That is also
what we will focus on today. But before doing so, it is still worthwhile
to focus on <em>why</em> we code in the first place.</p>
<p>Coding is a form of abstraction: we make sense of large (sometimes
overwhelming) amounts of qualitative data – somtimes referred to as
“unstructured data” and generate some structure by coding it. This
abstraction is not cost free: by <em>forcing</em> codes onto your data,
you may lose some nuance and specificity. Some qualitative traditions
will therefore encourage you to only start coding once you are deeply
familiar with your data. Most traditions encourage an ongoing
back-and-forth between data and codes to make sure data and codes
match.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of codes varies strongly between qualitative
research traditions. In some traditions, codes are principally a
background tool, used to <em>organize</em> materials for later writing.
That is the case, for example, for most ethnographic writing, as well as
for many historically oriented approaches such as comparative historical
analysis (as used in sociology and political science) or process tracing
(as used in political science and administrative sciences). You will
rarely find a mention of codes, coding schemas, or a codebook in
published work using these methods, and not all of its practitioners may
apply codes to data at all.</p>
<p>In other approaches, such as thematic analysis or discourse analysis,
codes are a key <em>analytic</em> outcome. Here, codes don’t just
organize the data but are used a tool to give it meaning. In
publications using these methods, the codes and their development are
typically made explicit and often form the core of the methods section.
The tools we provide in this workshop can help you with either type of
analysis, but as you develop your coding schema, you want to be clear
where you situate yourself methodologically.</p>
<p>Beginning qualitative researchers often want to jump right into
analyzing data once documents are added to a project, but taking the
time to develop a coding protocol first can save time and improve the
transparency and quality of research.</p>
<p>The first step is typically to choose a coding philosophy, that is,
to decide <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> code labels will be chosen and
applied. Coding philosophies range along a spectrum from
<strong>inductive</strong> to <strong>deductive</strong> approaches.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="deductive-and-inductive-reasoning">Deductive and Inductive Reasoning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deductive-and-inductive-reasoning"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Deductive reasoning begins from assumptions and hypotheses. It seeks
to determine, using logic or data, whether the hypotheses can be shown
to be false (or true).</p>
<p>Experimental methods in many disciples follow this pattern. First, a
hypothesis or prediction about the effect of some cause is developed
based on past research and observation. An experiment is conducted to
isolate that specific potential cause, and conclusions are drawn based
on the presence (or lack) of difference made by the difference.</p>
<p>A medicine trial is a classic example of a deductive approach.
Scientists predict a treatment will help people in a specific way (for
example, by reducing the length of an infection). They recruit
participants (patients with the infection) who are randomly assigned so
that some receive the medicine and others receive a placebo with no
medicine. If the length of the infection is statistically shorter in the
patients who received the medicine, that is taken as evidence that the
medicine likely produced the desired result.</p>
<p>Deductive reasoning relies on minimizing exposure to outside
variables that might affect the outcome of interest, or otherwise
statistically adjusting for potential confounding factors.</p>
<p>Inductive reasoning, by contrast, seeks to draw more naturalistic
conclusions by making close observations while recognizing personal
biases and limits to observation. Inductive qualitative research draws
on patterns observed in data to make predictions, generalizations, or
analogies about more general patterns. Put differently, deductive
research is typically <strong>explanatory</strong> in nature, while
inductive research is <strong>exploratory</strong>.</p>
<p>Inductive social research often draws on critical or constructivist
perspectives that emphasize how individuals and groups describe their
own experience.</p>
<p>Taken in a longer scope, science can only develop through the
complementary use of induction and deduction, sometimes visualized as a
circular cycle. Observation is used to develop hypotheses, which are
tested deductively through more observation. If hypotheses are not fully
confirmed, inductive reasoning is used to develop revised or alternative
hypotheses.</p>
<p>[FIGURE OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESS]</p>
<p>Even though deductive and inductive reasoning are both part of nearly
every study in some way, how qualitative data is coded depends on the
general purpose of the study. Exploratory studies tend to adopt an
inductive method, while explanatory studies use more deductive
approaches to code development.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In 1967, US sociologists Glaser and Strauss formalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory" class="external-link"><em>grounded
theory</em></a>, one method for conducting structured qualitative
research without presupposing a hypothesis or theory. They recognized
that how people <em>experience</em> the world can be at least as
important as traditional measures (i.e., personal income or gross
domestic product).</p>
<p>In grounded theory and other inductive coding methods, qualitative
data like interview transcripts are read carefully and initial codes are
applied that match the language and interpretation proposed by study
participants themselves as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Often, researchers label codes in this <strong>open coding</strong>
phase by using their judgment and experience to discern underlying
themes in the experiences expressed across interviews.</p>
<p>In our scenario, the goal of this analysis is to prepare for
collecting and analyzing new data related to social media privacy and
confidentiality. <code>BSR_05</code> is with a PhD student studying
political communication.</p>
<p>Open the <code>Coding</code> tab in QualCoder and click on
<code>BSR05_transcript_deidentified</code> in the <code>Documents</code>
list to open it for coding on the right. <code>Sara Mannheimer</code> is
the interviewer and <code>BSR05</code> replaces the name of the student
for privacy protection.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/qualcoder-coding-view.png" alt="Image of QualCoder with document BSR_05 open to the 03:49 timestamp in coding view" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Codes (labels) are applied to text segments that reflect a particular
concept, theme or idea. Before applying a code, it must be created in
the Codes list or the Code organizer.</p>
<p>We imported an existing project and the codes used by the original
study team already appear in the codes list. Before creating new codes,
take a look at the <em>coding tree</em> in the Code organizer
(<code>Coding - Code organizer</code>). After opening the organizer and
reading the warning about the risks of modifying codes, click the
outline symbol (<code>select code branch</code>), then choose
<code>All</code> and click <code>OK</code>. You should see each code,
with lines connecting codes to <em>categories</em>. Each category can
contain any number of codes, and categories can be nested within other
categories (i.e.,
<code>curation - technical requirements of bad</code>).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/qualcoder-code-organizer.png" alt="Image of QualCoder code organizer showing the 'curation - technical requirements of bad' category in a white box with 5 subcategories of varying colors connected to it via lines. The 'curation - innovative repository practices with bar' subcategory also has 2 subcategories of its own, one of which contains 3 codes." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We will use categories to distinguish between codes created using
different processes. Click the <code>Create category</code> button and
name a category <code>1_Mannheimer</code>; this will contain all the
codes created by the previous study team so we can easily separate them
from ours. To move an existing code or category under
<code>1_Mannheimer</code>, right-click its box and select
<code>Link code to category</code>. After selecting the correct code and
choosing <code>OK</code>, that code becomes a subcode of
<code>1_Mannheimer</code>.</p>

</h3>
<p>An alternative approach to inductive coding, <em>in vivo coding</em>,
tries to further reduce researcher bias effects by creating initial code
labels only from the language used in the interviews themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a passage slightly earlier in the paragraph we’ve been
working with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we ended up using that data for a project on looking at how
people disclosed early in the hashtag campaign, and how that may have
produced stigma around kind of disclosing for other women to disclose
experiencing sexual violence. So it was kind of a sensitive data
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person being interviewed used a number of words and phrases that
may be relevant to data privacy protection in these sentences including
disclosed, stigma, disclosing, disclose, experience, sexual violence,
and sensitive data. Rather than categorizing themes at this stage, in
vivo coding retains language used by the participants.</p>
<p>After creating another category for <code>in_vivo</code> codes, let’s
highlight “disclosed” and apply a new in vivo code called “disclose”.
The same tag can be applied to “disclosing” and “disclose;” although
they are different words, they have the same root word and express the
same idea.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/qualcoder-coding-invivo.png" alt="Image of QualCoder text coding screen. The code 'disclose' is highlighted in red within a category called 'in_vivo'.

<p><strong>Compromise</strong> does not seem relevant here, as the
presence of online harassment suggests the advantage of
<em>stricter</em> protections, if anything.</p>
<p><strong>Stake</strong> clearly applies. The Twitter users are

encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>Like inductive and deductive reasoning, the separation between
inductive and deductive coding is rarely complete. As a researcher, how

depend on personal research questions and values, as well as norms in
the fields where the research will be shared.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Practice deductive coding</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Practice coding documents by applying the deductive codes we
developed (<code>autonomy</code>, <code>compromise</code> and
<code>stake</code>) to some participant’s answers to the following
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell me about a time (if any) during the process of your example when
you considered issues of privacy (e.g. protecting data during research,
considering restricted access or TweetIDs only if publishing).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apply the three deductive codes to the following interview time
segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSR_01 <code>24:33 - 29:13</code>
</li>
<li>BSR_02 <code>35:09 - 44:21</code>
</li>
<li>BSR_05 <code>33:08 - 40:57</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will likely take quite a while, particularly for those new to
qualitative coding. Don’t hesitate to get the attention of the
instructor or helper when you need assistance.</p>
<p>Read the surface text carefully, but also watch for implied reference
to themes. The excerpt below doesn’t include the word <code>stake</code>
or a synonym, but probably meets the definition that stake is when
“concern derives from being personally affected by privacy or
sharing.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BSR01 27:33 So they were anonymous in the sense that I couldn’t tie
it to their real identity. But some people use this same username on all
these online platforms. And that is that that is a concern. So let’s say
there’s a user in my data who said something they regret, and they
delete their post or their comment. It’s stil going to be there in my
data set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, all three deductive codes might apply to this particular
excerpt. Part of the concern is that users didn’t have
<code>autonomy</code> over how their data might be connected, and the
situation resulted from <code>compromise</code> between wanting to share
data openly while protecting user privacy.</p>
<p>At other times, the label for a code may directly apply, but it may
not be relevant to how the label is being used for your research. In the
block starting at <code>35:58</code> in <code>BSR_05</code>, we
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So at the time that we collected the data, you, you couldn’t get
replies to tweets through the Twitter API. So it’s like only the keyword
tweets. But we’ve felt that it was really important to have replies to
Me Too tweets, because that’s the conversational part. And so it kind of
put us into position where the only way to get them was to do the web
scraping, which is against Twitter Terms of Service, technically.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But we had conversations, that came up about whether we should use
them and whether… not like whether we should tell people we use them,
but like, yeah, whether we should use them in the analysis, which would
affect whether like we report it in the paper or not. So like, these
kind of back and forth conversations where a lot of… I guess like just
walking around the ethical markers, like trying to weigh, like, this is
the benefit of doing this, versus this is the cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So with the scraping, it’s like the benefit is—you get this much
fuller picture of me too. Versus there’s potentially legal consequences
here. And then with the releasing of tweet IDs, you know, the benefits
of open science, being able to facilitate further research on this.
Versus the cost, which is like potential harm to the participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excerpt discusses a process of negotiated compromise around
whether to use data gathered in violation of the Twitter terms of
service. The code we developed, however, is specifically for compromises
related to user privacy. In this case, there was no privacy issue for
users and coding this excerpt to <code>compromise</code> would serve to
confuse, rather than inform, our analysis.</p>
<p>Not all codes will necessarily apply in each document. In qualitative
research, both the content related to a topic and whether it is present
at all provide data to help understand people and contexts.</p>

<p>Most qualitative projects require more than one round of coding for a
few reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first documents rarely highlight every relevant theme. Themes
and language important in later interviews may still be reflected in
early interviews but less obvious before the theme was brought to the
researcher’s attention. Revisiting early interviews supports consistent
code application.</li>
<li>Multiple coders may use tags in slightly different ways, which
eventually need to be adjusted to a consistent scheme.</li>
<li>Key relationships between codes may only become obvious once initial
codes are considered, leading to consolidation or the development of new
tags as researchers become more familiar with the documents and
themes.</li>
<li>When coding in vivo, people may use language differently and
multiple phrases may represent a single idea.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Axial coding</strong> primarily addresses numbers 3 and 4, as
it is involves relating or further breaking down primary themes or
codes.</p>
<p>For example, the passage in <code>BSR_05</code> coded to
<code>in vivo - disclosure</code> concerned self-disclosure of personal
information during the #MeToo movement with the hope of reducing stigma
and producing a positive outcome. But Twitter users in
<code>BSR_02</code> may have been subject to disclosure of personal
information without consent. Axial coding might involve distinguishing
disclosure based on whether it was voluntary or self-directed.</p>
<p>Axial coding takes many other forms, depending on the research topic
and methods. Deductive research may revise and further specify existing
theory based on new data in their study. In vivo codes or open codes
that seemed distinct may turn out to be conceptually indistinguishable.
Participants may be provided summaries of initial findings and asked if
they reflect their personal experience. In all cases, axial coding is a
tool to clarify analysis and theory.</p>
<p>Qualitative studies typically have one or more rounds of initial
coding, followed by any amount of axial coding necessary to represent
key concepts intelligibly to both researchers and study
participants.</p>

of what all is matches a particular code in your document corpus using
coding view.</p>
<p>The <code>Coding report</code> allows you to view every text passage
coded to a single code (or set of codes), optionally restricted to
specific source documents. This can be a great help to axial coding
because you can look at one or more related codes more closely to see if
they should be merged, split, relabeled, or left as-is.</p>

<p>By the end of coding, researchers can be quite familiar with the
data. Even if they have already drawn some tentative conclusions,
structured data analysis is important to validate findings, discover
alternatives, and document evidence and rationales. This step increases
the research’s impact and value not just for others, but for future
revision or expansion of your own research.</p>
<p>How you can analyze your data depends on multiple decisions,
including your software, the type of data you have, and how you
structured your codes. But the choice of methods also depend on your
research questions.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="cases">Cases<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cases"></a>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In qualitative analysis, cases most often represent individual
people, like those interviewed in the BSR interviews.</p>
<p>You may have already done some informal case-based analysis by
observing the types of privacy concerns different researchers
encountered or how they went about dealing with them.</p>
<p>Case analysis considers the similarities and differences between
individuals to help understand people holistically, including their
unique contexts. In its most basic form, reading an interview is a form
of case analysis. Often, researchers keep notes about individual cases,
which may include summaries of relevant information and thoughts about
how different themes and personal characteristics seem related in that
individual’s view of the world.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Themes inevitably emerge when studying cases, but are ultimately
considered as part of specific contexts. Thematic analysis, by contrast,
focuses on how themes are similar or different across cases. Goals can
include constructing general models of a concept, discovering how
circumstances can impact an individual’s mental model of a concept, and
testing the validity of theoretical propositions in lived
experience.</p>
<p>Each labeled code can be treated as a potential theme, and Taguette
provides a direct way to view all highlights coded to a specific
tag.</p>
<p>First, click the <code>Highlights</code> tab in the top left. Then,
click the name of the desired tag. Instead of an interview, the right
pane will now display the text of each highlight coded to that tag, as
well as its document, and a list of all tags applied to the same
highlight.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/taguette-highlight-view.png" alt="Image of Taguette showing highlights for the deductive tag named autonomy" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>There are many ways to perform theme analysis. The tags below each
highlight are interactive and allow you to quickly navigate to that
document or theme by clicking, making it easier to iteratively explore
the context of highlights or relationships between themes.</p>
<p>You may want to take notes on sub-themes or variations within a theme
in a separate document. Alternately, you can add new highlights as you
work more closely with individual themes, although highlights and tags
can only be added after returning to document view.</p>
<p>Taguette also provides a count of the number of highlights to which
each tag has been applied, which can give a quick sense of how
ubiquitous themes are across your data. Be cautious about using such
counts to draw conclusions, however. A theme may be mentioned only a
small number of times but still be critical to understanding a topic or
how subgroups of individuals think about that theme.</p>
<p>Some software also allows counting the number of times themes appear
in each document or case. This, too, can provide a basic read on how
widely relevant specific themes are. But again, counts cannot reveal the
richness of the stories qualitative research is designed to engage, so
exercise judgment before using them as a primary analytic tool.</p>

<p>Framework matrices are a type of visual organizer some qualitative
researchers use to conduct and interpret analysis. A framework matrix
places one case or group in each row and one theme in each column, with
the themes related to a single overarching framework. Once the table is
set up (on a computer or by hand), the researcher fills each cell with
one or more quotes or summaries that encapsulate that theme for the case
or group.</p>
<p>This process is undertaken systematically, following these steps
outlined by <a href="/files/goldsmith-2021-framework-analysis.pdf">Laurie J.
Goldsmith</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data familiarization</li>
<li>Identifying a thematic framework</li>
<li>Indexing all study data against the framework</li>
<li>Charting to summarize the indexed data</li>
<li>Mapping and interpretation of patterns found within the chart</li>
</ol>

<p>Much of the work of analysis and theory-building is part of creating
a framework matrix, and so, by the time you finish, you’ll likely
already be much closer to answering research questions. That said, there
are also advantages to working with a framework matrix during the
analytic process, as well as their utility as a summary tool for
others.</p>
<p>Reading across columns, within a line, on a framework matrix allows
for analyzing cases. Reading down rows, within a column, allow for
thematic analysis. And having both summarized together opens up options
to study how clusters of cases may share similar approaches to themes.
This kind of intersectional analysis can be done informally, or can be
used to create formal case classifications or thematic typologies to
stimulate further theory-building and research.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Sentiment and degree</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Sometimes, particularly when considering deductive hypotheses, it is
not enough to code only for the presence or absence of a theme. In such
situations, semi-quantitative coding may be applied in one of at least
two ways.</p>
<p>Sentiment codes indicate whether the feeling or attitude expressed in
an excerpt of text is positive, neutral, negative, or mixed in relation
to a theme. Neutral and mixed can be hard to distinguish. Neutral
sentiment is generally unbothered about good or bad in relation to
something, while a mixed sentiment includes both positive and negative
feelings, often toward different aspects or implications.</p>
<p>In the excerpt below from <code>BSR_02</code>, certain Wikipedia
contributors are attributed a negative sentiment toward contribution
disclosures, which might also be framed as a positive sentiment toward
privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of them like hold ideological views that are against like the
counting of contributions. And they’re just like, “I don’t believe that
that’s something we should be doing. And so I want to remove myself from
this list.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentiment codes can be applied in the same way as other codes, for
example with a tag for <code>sentiment: positive.</code> They work best
when applied to the same highlight as a single thematic code, so there
is no ambiguity as to which theme is associated with the sentiment.</p>
<p>An alternative way to integrate degrees of valuation into qualitative
coding is to code on a scale. For example, the amount of stake that a
sexual assault survivor has in protecting their identity from disclosure
is higher than that of a Wikipedia contributor who wishes to remain
anonymous to avoid attention. Scales typically are numeric with a
relatively small number of rating points, such as a three-point
<code>Low</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>High</code> scale.</p>
<p>Occasionally, qualitative data also asks about specific quantitative
measures that may have more natural units, such as a study of childhood
reading experiences that asks about how many minutes a day each parent
reads to their child.</p>
<p>Taguette provides no option to attach a numeric rating to a tag. It
is again possible to create a separate set of codes to capture ratings,
as described above for sentiment, but many full-featured paid CAQDAS
packages provide native ratings functionality.</p>

<p>Many qualitative researchers prefer not to share or archive their
data and analysis. In large part, this is because of the amount of
interpretive labor they invest, along with frequent direct trusted
connections with groups and individuals being studied. This trust can
take time to develop before and during data collection, whether as
participants or observers.</p>
<p>There are important advantages to archiving and sharing data,
however, even for qualitative data. Each researcher ultimately must make
their own decisions, but this final section will outline potential
values and risks of archiving or sharing data, as well as how to go
about doing so in Taguette.</p>

<p>Data sharing and interchangeable data formats have only recently
become someone widespread in qualitative research. Be aware that
information in this section may rapidly become out of date, and if in
doubt, consult with a human subjects protection board, archivist, or
librarian at your institution or the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/" class="external-link">Qualitative Data Repository</a> before
sharing data.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="import-and-export-in-taguette">Import and export in Taguette<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#import-and-export-in-taguette"></a>
</h2>
<p>Taguette projects are automatically saved either to the cloud or your
local computer, depending on whether you use the local
<code>Single-user mode</code> or sign into [Taguette Cloud][<a href="https://app.taguette.org/" class="external-link">taguette_cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Projects and codebooks can both be exported and imported in Taguette.
Projects exported from the <code>Project info</code> tab are saved as
<code>sqlite3</code> databases. They’re designed primarily for personal
archiving and sharing or moving between cloud and local versions, so
they work best if opened in Taguette. There is no tool currently
available to automatically convert a Taguette project to a format
compatible with other CAQDAS, although <code>sqlite3</code> is an open
database format. This means the data can be accessed using other
compatible software even if Taguette is no longer usable, although
databases are not designed for qualitative analysis off the shelf.</p>
<p>To import a previously-exported project in Taguette, click
<code>Home</code> at the top to exit to the projects list. From there,
click <code>Import a project file</code>, find the file you saved, and
import. All documents, highlights, and tags should be intact.</p>
<div id="other-qualitative-data-formats" class="callout">

</div>
<div id="other-qualitative-data-formats" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Other qualitative data formats</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Each major CAQDAS package has its own proprietary data format,
specialized to its features. In most cases, projects cannot be moved
between software in these formats, Taguette’s included. Data files in
some software may also be restricted to specific platforms (Windows or
Mac) or software versions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.qdasoftware.org/" class="external-link">REFI-QDA standard</a>
offers an alternative, the <code>QDPX</code> format. <code>QDPX</code>
was developed in collaboration between researchers and major package
developers, that provides the ability to move projects in a standard
format between every major package. It is an open standard which anyone
can use and adapt. Because packages structure data differently and have
distinct advanced feature sets, some data may fail to import into the
target tool. For <a href="understanding-refi-qda.html">more information
about REFI-QDA see here</a>.</p>
<p>Taguette currently only implements the codebook portion of the
<code>QDPX</code> standard, and only for export. To export a codebook
that can be imported in other software, choose
<code>Export codebook</code> from the <code>Project info</code> tab and
select <code>QDC (XML)</code>.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-sharing-for-collaboration">Data sharing for collaboration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-sharing-for-collaboration"></a>
</h2>
<p>Working with collaborators is one of the most common reasons for
sharing qualitative projects. The most direct option for sharing
Taguette projects with collaborators is to use <a href="https://app.taguette.org/" class="external-link">Taguette Cloud</a>. From the
<code>Project info</code> tab, <code>Manage collaborators</code> allows
you to add other users (they need to sign up first) and select the level
of permissions they have to view, change, or even delete the
project.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you only want to share a specific portion of the
project with collaborators. The document or highlight view can be
exported with the dropdown at the top right in <code>HTML</code>
(webpage), <code>DOCX</code> (Word), or <code>PDF</code> (Adobe) format.
Unlike sharing the original document, exporting this view, will show
highlights and add tags in brackets so collaborators can see what codes
have been applied.</p>
<p>Highlight view behaves similarly, with the addition of a
<code>CSV</code> format that can be opened in Excel or other spreadsheet
or data analysis software.</p>
<p>Finally, a codebook can be automatically generated from the
<code>Project info</code> tab that lists code labels, the number of
highlights they have been applied to, and any description added to the
codes. Formats include all those listed above, as well as
<code>QDC</code> XML format (see “Other qualitative data formats”
above).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="transparency-and-reuse">Transparency and reuse<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transparency-and-reuse"></a>
</h2>
<p>Certain scientific disciplines have called for research transparency,
including sharing data and analytic procedures, with momentum growing in
many social sciences. Until recently, that effort was primarily applied
to quantitative data, such as surveys, experiments, and “big data”
gathered from the internet.</p>
<p>A small number of projects are working to change that perception and
promote the thoughtful, informed, careful sharing of qualitative and
mixed methods data as well, led in part by the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/" class="external-link">Qualitative Data Repository</a> and enabled
by improvements in sharing like the <code>REFI-QDA</code> standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="helping-future-you">Helping future you<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#helping-future-you"></a>
</h2>
<p>If the arguments above don’t convince you that it’s good and worth
the effort to archive qualitative data securely, there is one more
important case to be made.</p>
<p>Archiving your data in an open and interchangeable format that is
backed up in multiple locations can help future you. If your only copy
of your project is on your laptop and it is lost or destroyed before
analysis and review are complete, or if you decide you want to do
additional analysis later, there isn’t much that can be done short of
repeating a large amount of work.</p>
<p>Taguette’s single-user mode only stores data on your computer, and
Taguette Cloud only saves it to the Taguette servers, which could go
down at any time. Whether or not you plan to share or reuse your data,
consider exporting your project from Taguette at key points, such as
after you’ve completed initial or axial coding.</p>

<p>This lesson has covered basic principles of qualitative research, as
well as how to use Taguette for qualitative coding and data analysis.
With that foundation, the next step is to find or collect your own data
and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>In addition to the Qualitative Data Repository (used and discussed
here), some other social science data archives such as ICPSR have
qualitative sections. For qualitative content analysis, there are
thousands of open-access archives of documents, research, education
resources, and even entire books.</p>
