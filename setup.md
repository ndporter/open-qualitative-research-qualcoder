In this workshop, we will practice reusing qualitative data with the software aguette and a collection of interviews about data reuse published online. Please follow the steps below before the workshop to set up your computer.

## Data Sets

The data we will use is available from the [Qualitative Data Repository][qdr] (QDR) and requires creating a free QDR account. You are welcome to create an account before the workshops, but we will walk through the process of setting up an account and downloading the data during the workshop.

## Software Setup

We will use the free Coding and Qualitative Data Analysis software QualCoder throughout the workshop. QualCoder is a cross-platform tool that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Visit the QualCoder Wiki [instructions page][qualcoder_install_instructions] for details on how to install on your system.
